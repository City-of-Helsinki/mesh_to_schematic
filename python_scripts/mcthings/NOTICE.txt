edited vox.py to make it up to date with github version -edited things so it uses more block for more colors

edited blocks_memory.py to make it up to date with github version. Changed return self.to_nbt(init_pos, end_pos, self) to return self.to_nbt(init_pos, end_pos) since self is first argument. Made it use build_schematic_nbt from utils.py
